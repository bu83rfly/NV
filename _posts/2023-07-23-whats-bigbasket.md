## Introduction
BigBasket is an online Grocery store that aims to provide groceries to the household in an easy manner.

## Founders of BigBasket
Bigbasket was started by 5 Entrepreneurs V.S. Sudhakar, Hari Menon, V.S. Ramesh, Vipul Parekh, and Abhinay Choudhari.

## The Problem BigBasket Sought to Solve
In 2011, when the Mobile industry was on Boom, these 5 people thought that everything is available on the internet except for Groceries, which they took as a Eureka Moment. Below are the problems they tried to resolve.

1. Fulfill the daily needs of people by providing them easy access to groceries online.
2. How to supply the groceries to the people on time.
3. Deliver Organic food to the people.

## How BigBasket Started
When the founders did not have their own warehouses, they used to purchase groceries from Metro Cash and Carry Stores. They used to wake up at 3:30 am to buy groceries from local farmers and local wholesale fruits and vegetable markets. Eventually, BigBasket built its cooling infrastructure â€” walk-in freezers, chill rooms, refrigerated warehouses, and a fleet of trucks, enabling the Company to purchase fresh products at competitive rates.

## Business and Revenue Models
They use two kinds of models
1. **Inventory Model:** Using this Model, They buy products from leading suppliers such as P&G, HUL, farmers, etc, and store them in their warehouses to fulfill consumer demands on time.
2. **Hyper Local Model:** They have tie-ups with 2000+ grocery stores, to deliver products within 1 hour to the neighborhoods.
3. They also have a physical store known as Fresho that will soon serve as a revenue generator for the company.

## Customer Propositions and Success Rates
The three most important factors/USPs due to which BigBasket is Successful today are:
1. On-time Delivery
2. Same-day Delivery
3. High Fill rate

When BB shifted to the Inventory Model, they introduced a same-day delivery model with a delivery charge of Rs 30, which led to high Fill rates and doubled the reach to 18%. As they tied up with more than 2000 stores, their inventory rates decreased and decreased the wastage. They introduced the option of 90-minute deliveries.
