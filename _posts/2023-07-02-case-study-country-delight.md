>50 years back, life was very simple. We used to have a cow in our backyard that gave us natural and fresh milk everyday. There was never a need to worry about adulteration since we owned the animal. Today, the milk we consume is either reconstituted/recombined with milk powder or takes days to reach our home post milking which is prone to adulteration. - Chakradhar Gade & Nitin Kaushal
